The software evaluates permutation entropy (PE) of signals using the standard definition of PE. It allows use arbitrary number of dimensions (number of measuring points) and arbitrary lag (distance of neighboring measuring points). The output is evaluated entropy that is exported in 'csv' format, and the PE curve gets exported as a PNG picture.
